# Mission Statement

## Goal
The simple app allows the shopper to see the latest list of items for a given store and act on each item as she goes through the list.

## What the app does

### Information
* When user comes to the app the first time, she sees the shopping list for a default store
* She can change to a different store and see the list for that
* The list has a timestamp of the last time it was edited
* Each item on the list indicates the following
  * the name of the item
  * its location, usually the aisle or section
  * urgency of the item (needed or optional)
  * some indication of whether it has to be organic

### Actions
* User can provide status for an item
  * available and bought
  * not available and not bought
  * not available but raincheck is bought
* once the action is provided, the item will look different to indicate it no longer needs attention
* however, if user made a mistake, there should be a way to bring the item back to "active"
